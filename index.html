   The main topic for this article is Supernovas and how powerful they are, what causes them and the aftereffects of them. They are important because they create elements as well as helping us further understand space;
   by studying these phenomena, scientists can learn about the age, size and composition of the universe. The aim of this article is to explore more about supernovas and gain a basic understanding of them. 
   The key findings of this article are how they are formed, the side effects caused, their importance, their benefits to the universe, some challenges faced in observing them and their importance to other
   fields of studies.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p class="exl">
  </pre>
   A supernova is a massive explosion that happens when a star dies. It's one of the most powerful events in the universe. Supernovas are important in astrophysics as they create new elements such as gold, silver, 
   uranium. These elements are spread out throughout the galaxy, where they may eventually create new stars or planets. There are two types of supernovas, one of these is called the core-collapse supernova, these occur
   when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses under its own gravity, the collapse triggers a shock wave that blows the star apart. Another type of supernova, called a thermal runaway supernova, can occur when 
   two stars orbit each other, and one or both of those stars is a white dwarf. White dwarfs are the remains of a star roughly the size of our Sun when it runs out of fuel. If the stars in one of these binary systems
   collide, or if one of the white dwarfs absorbs enough matter from the other star, the white dwarf can become a supernova (DOE Explains...Supernovae | Department of Energy). Some of the key phenomenon associated with
   supernovas are massive energy releases, impact on star formation and remnants. This topic will allow broader understanding of the universe due to supernovas being studied and information gathered from them. 
   This data can then be used to unravel the mysteries of the universe.

<p class="exl">
   <pre>
   Stars are born, they live, and they die. Many terminate their thermonuclear lives after billions of years of cooking light elements into heavier elements by ejecting their outer hydrogen-rich envelopes over perhaps
   hundreds of years. In the process, they give birth to compact white dwarf stars that are half as massive as the Sun but a hundred times smaller. Such dense remnants cool off over billions of years like dying
   embers plucked from a fire. A subset of these white dwarfs in binary stel lar systems will later (perhaps hundreds of millions of years later) ignite spectacular thermonuclear explosions. Owing to their brightness
   from across the Universe, many of these so-called type Ia supernovae are used to take its measure (A. Burrows, D. Vartanyan (2020) these thermonuclear explosions take place there are remontants left behind which 
   can contain information about the original system that exploded. They are full of activity, containing very powerful magnetic fields and hot plasma that can generate shock waves in the surrounding materials. 
   Therefore, supernova remnants are vital in understanding the life cycle of stars and the physical processes in very extreme environments (Supernovas & Remnants). 

   The study of supernovas is a fascinating area however there are some challenges such as these events being extremely rare, in our galaxy there are only a few supernova explosions per century, therefore making them
   difficult to study in detail. Another challenge is that supernovas can happen in distant galaxies making them difficult to observe as light can take millions of years to reach Earth. Supernovas could also be
   difficult to detect as they can be hidden by clous of gas and dust or they may be too faint to see. Despite these challenges, astronomers have made significant progress in studying supernovae. They use powerful
   telescopes and sophisticated techniques to observe these events and learn more about them (Hidden supernova spotted by Spitzer NASA) (Supernova, ESA/Hubble) 

   Supernovae have a big impact on other fields of study, like cosmology and planetary science. In cosmology, Supernovae are used to measure the expansion rate of the universe. By studying how supernovae change in 
   brightness over time, scientists can determine how fast the universe is expanding. This helps us understand the age and fate of the universe. While in planetary science, Supernovae can create elements like gold,
   silver, and uranium. These elements are spread throughout the galaxy and can eventually become part of new planets. So, supernovae play a role in creating the building blocks of planets, including our own Earth.
   Therefore, they are important in other fields of studies to continue to reveal more about the cosmos (Physics StudySmarter UK).

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="exl">
   <pre>   
   Some of the most powerful events in the cosmos — the explosions of dying stars known as supernovae — not only mold the cosmos, but also serve as critical stepping stones in the creation of heavy elements. 
   The investigation of these celestial fireworks provides scientists with clues about the history, composition, and rate of expansion of the universe. As exciting as they are, such cosmic events certainly 
   present obstacles to researchers. This means that they are rarely seen, and since they often reside at high altitudes, it is sometimes hard to perform a direct observation of them. Still, the use of new telescopes,
   as well as cutting-edge analysis tools, has solved a great deal about supernovae. Our appreciation of the profound influence of supernovae grows with our deepening understanding.
